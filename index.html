                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It's a versatile language that allows developers to build dynamic web content, ranging from simple animations to complex web applications. JavaScript code is typically embedded directly into HTML documents and executed by the browser.</p>

                <h2>Syntax</h2>
                <p>JavaScript syntax is similar to other programming languages like Java and C, but it also has its own unique features. Here are some key points about JavaScript <br>

                1. JavaScript statements are typically terminated by semicolons (;).<br>
                2. Comments can be added using double slashes (//) for single-line comments or /* */ for multi-line comments.<br>
                3. JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning variables, functions, and keywords must be written with consistent capitalization.<br>
                4. Blocks of code are enclosed in curly braces ({ }).<br>
            </p>
            </section>
            <section id="variables">
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data that can be manipulated or accessed later in the program. Variables can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords. Here's a brief explanation of each:<br>

                    1. var: Declares a variable with function scope.<br>
                    2. let: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.<br>
                    3. const: Declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after initialization.</p>

                <h2>Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    Functions in JavaScript are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the function keyword, followed by a name (optional) and a set of parentheses containing parameters (also optional), and then a block of code enclosed in curly braces. </p>
